# Student-Engagement-Starter-Kit

The Student Engagement Starter Kit connects data from a Learning Management
System* (LMS) with the Ed-Fi ODS/API and presents a Power BI dashboard to help
teachers and administrators rapidly gain insight on student engagement with the
LMS.

\* Currently, three LMS's are supported via the [LMS
Toolkit](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/LMS-Toolkit):

1. Canvas
2. Google Classroom
3. Schoology

## Getting Started
